# Fantasy Football Matchup Stat Chrome Add-on

Simple Google Chrome add-on that scrapes CBS fantasy football stats for easy viewing in a popup window. The motivation for this was to be able to view historical CBS Sports positional statistics without having to navigate away from my fantasy team on ESPN. 

## Features

- Loads a position's performance against a particular team over the course of the season. This data can be useful in choosing matchups (i.e., which running back that you have might have a more favorable matchup)

## Setup

1. Download the repo in a zip file
2. If GitHub zips it up, unzip the folder (because the files are very small, it may not zip it)
3. Open up Google Chrome and navigate to ```chrome://extensions```
4. Drag the folder onto the extensions window
